## What is a Slack Alert?

A Slack Alert sends one or more <a href="/docs/product-manual/intent-signal">Intent Signals</a> to a Slack channel. Each channel can also have an <a href="/docs/product-manual/audience">Audience</a> as a filter, so that only updates about certain sets of visitors or accounts go to that Slack channel.

## What do the Slack messages reps receive look like?

*Note: there is quite a bit of message customizability, but the above is a "default" template.*

## How do I create, edit, and delete Slack Alerts?

<Note>
    In order to use Slack Alerts, you'll first need to connect your Slack workspace to Koala. Read more about the <a href="/docs/integrations/slack">Slack integration</a>.
