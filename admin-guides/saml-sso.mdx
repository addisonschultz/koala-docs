Koala organizations on every plan can use Sign in with Google. Organizations on the Business plan can configure additional SAML providers. This guide will walk you through how to configure SAML SSO for Okta as an example, but the steps are similar for other SAML providers.

## Okta SAML SSO

To configure Okta SAML SSO, you must:

* Be in Admin mode in Okta.
* Have admin permissions in Koala and be on the Business plan.

Now to the steps:

1. Visit the Security settings of your Koala workspace, and switch on the SAML SSO toggle.
2. Go back to Okta and create a [custom SAML application in Okta](https://help.okta.com/oag/en-us/content/topics/access-gateway/add-app-saml-pass-thru-add-okta.htm).
3. In the SAML Settings form copy the `Single-sign on URL` and `Audience URI (SP Entity ID)` from Koala to the Okta form.

4. For the attribute mappings we don't require any specific attributes, but the Application Username should be set to `Email`.
5. Click continue until the App in Okta is created.
6. Assign the app to the users or groups that should have access to Koala.
7. Now with the app in Okta created, go to the **"Sign On" tab** and click on **"More Details"** link to get the `Single Sign-On URL` and `Certificate`.

8. Go back to Koala and paste the Identity Provider `Single Sign-On URL` and the `X.509 Certificate` in the SAML SSO settings.
9. Click on Save and you are done.

<Note>
  After saving the SAML SSO settings, you will be logged out and will need to log back in. You have to type in your email address to initiate the SAML SSO flow.
