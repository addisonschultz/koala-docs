When you send an email, Koala can be notified of the identity of every click on your email.

## HubSpot

No action is necessary â€” Koala will automatically parse the HubSpot cookie to ensure any identities tracked in HubSpot will also be tracked in Koala.

## Outreach.io

## Custom links

If you're not using HubSpot or Outreach.io, you can still get this behavior by adding a `utm_id` parameter onto any link you send. Here's how you do it:

1. Start with your email address

```
tido@getkoala.com
```

2. Run a base64_encode on that email address

```
dGlkb0BnZXRrb2FsYS5jb20=
```

3. Add a `utm_id` parameter on a link to the website where Koala is installed:

```
https://getkoala.com/pricing?utm_id=dGlkb0BnZXRrb2FsYS5jb20=
```
