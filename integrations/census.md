You can use Census's <a href="https://docs.getcensus.com/destinations/available-destinations/http-request">HTTP Request API</a> to send any warehouse data as Account Traits or Visitor Traits.  Common use-cases include:

- Sending product consumption at account or visitor level
- Sending plan type
- Sending custom ML models (eg., churn prediction, LTV, etc.)

Contact support@getkoala.com and we'll work directly with your Census account team to get this set up.
