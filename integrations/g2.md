# Important Details
- In order to use the G2 integration, you must have G2's [Buyer Intent Subscription](https://sell.g2.com/g2-buyer-intent-data).
- You must currently be on the business-tier of Koala â€” if you're interested in exploring, [book time with us](https://calendly.com/nick-koala/koala-intro) to learn more. 

# Syncing from G2
Upon connecting your G2 account to Koala, we will start to sync the buyer intent and page views from G2 into Koala and transform them into events.

# Intent Signals

Create intent signals from G2 events by accessing the [Intent Signals settings](https://app.getkoala.com/goto/signals) page.

- Click on the upper right corner on `New Intent Signal`.
- Select the type of signal as `G2`.
- Configure the event matching rules.
- Give a name to your signal.

And you are good to go. You can use the signal for any notification, automation, or filter on Koala.
