If you are already a ZoomInfo customer, you can connect Koala to your ZoomInfo account
via your secret key.

To find your ZoomInfo secret key:
- Log in to the ZoomInfo GUI using admin credentials with API access.
- Go to Admin Portal, then API and click Generate New Key. You are provided with a Client ID and a Private Key.

This integration can be used to enrich any contacts found in Koala via ZoomInfo.
