### Introduction

There are two ways that you can receive messages from Koala in Slack.

- Real-time notifications about intent via Slack Alerts
- Share an account to a channel

Each is discussed more in detail below.

### Real-time notifications about intent via Slack Alerts

If you'd like to automatically receive notifications whenever high-intent activities
happen, use Slack Alerts. The easiest way to get started is in the
[Slack Alerts tab](https://app.getkoala.com/goto/slack-alerts).

You can pick which **Intent Signals** you'd like to be notified about, and optionally specify an audience. You can send to any **existing public channel**, or create a **new public channel** inline. Here's how you configure it:

On the other side, once the intent is triggered, you'll get a notification in Slack:

![Public Channel Notification](/images/public-channel-notif.png)

### Share an account to a channel

If you'd like to manually share an interesting account to start a discussion
with the team, you can easily share any account with any channel. Navigate to
any **account profile page** in Koala and look for the Slack icon at the top:

![Share Account 1](/images/integrations/slack/share-in-slack.png)

In the Slack channel, it will appear like this:

![Share Account 2](/images/share-account-2.png)

### Subscribe to specific audiences

You can also create Slack Alerts that notify you about intent for specific audiences. You can configure these directly from the Slack Alerts creation flow, or from an audience page.

To set one up, follow these steps:
- Select (or create) an audience [here](https://app.getkoala.com/goto/views)
- Once you have navigated to the audience, click the **"Slack Alerts"** button at the top of the page
- Configure the channel you'd like to send notifications to, and the Intent Signals you want to know about.
- You're all set! Now whenever a new company or person shows the intent you wanted to know about, you'll
  get notified.
