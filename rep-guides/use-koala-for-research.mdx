Koala is an incredibly powerful tool for account research as part of your sales workflow. It helps you uncover previously hidden insights on the activity happening across your website and product.

### Key Concepts to Understand

**Fit Score**
Fit is based on the enrichment characteristics of the company. We analyze the Closed Won accounts in your company’s CRM instance and assign a letter grade:
- **A:** This is a great ICP fit and deserves attention, outbound efforts, and multithreading.
- **B:** This is on the fringe of ICP and should be taken seriously but qualified carefully.
- **C/D:** These are likely not a fit for a sales-led deal (there are exceptions, but prioritize your efforts elsewhere).

We recommend focusing your time on A fits – the top 25% of companies.

**Intent Score**
Intent is a real-time score (0-100) based on the number of visitors, the amount of active time spent on the platform, and recent intent signals. More activity increases this number, but it decays rapidly if intent dies down:
- **80-100:** Very High intent
- **50-80:** High intent
- **20-50:** Medium intent
- **0-20:** Low intent

**Trend**
This indicates how intent is trending in the past month, with special emphasis on the past week:
- **Surging:** Intent is rapidly increasing, likely due to many new visitors or more time being spent on the platform.
- **Heating:** Intent is rising but not as quickly as Surging.
- **Neutral:** Intent is staying the same.
- **Cooling:** Intent is declining.
- **New:** This is a new account we haven’t seen before.

### Using Koala for Account Research

#### Start with the Macro View
Spend a few minutes understanding what the company does, the industry they are in, and potential use cases.
- Use the Company tab to quickly learn about the company. If you already know about the company, you can skip this step. If not, you should be able to answer:
  - Is this a tiny startup, a growth-stage company, or a giant enterprise?
  - What industry are they in? (e.g., should you pitch them on Financial Services use cases?)
  - Do they have a relevant tech stack? (e.g., if you need them to use Kubernetes, do they have it installed?)
  - What do they do? If unclear, click on the domain to learn more.
- Look for recent intent signals. Understanding who has shown recent intent and what those signals were can help tailor your messaging to be more relevant.

#### Zoom in on the Micro View
Use the granular visitor detail to make a plan of attack.
- **Understand all known visitors:** The Visitors tab shows how every visitor is engaging. If you’re lucky, you’ll get some logged-in visitors, allowing you to see exactly who they are. Look them up or enrich them to get their titles and understand what access to power you already have versus what access to power you need.
- If you have many anonymous visitors, consult the guide on driving more known users. Koala offers many ways to get more known visitors.

**Understanding Anonymous Visitors**
Combine their geographical location and account name to deduce their identities. Using tools like Sales Navigator can help make educated guesses about who was on the site.

### Prioritize Your Efforts

**Account View**
In the account view, you’ll see all the accounts that have visited your website and product. Filter this down to the accounts that belong to you by using CRM filters to reflect what you have in Salesforce and HubSpot. You can also filter by time to see recent activity. This list helps prioritize your top accounts. For example, if 10 of your 50 top accounts score as HIGH intent, they’re likely great accounts to focus on right now.

**Visitor View**
In the visitor view, you’ll find a similar layout but with identified prospects. Typically, someone who is identified has filled out a form on your website or signed up for your product. You will see a similar set of scoring by Fit and level of intent based on the actions those prospects are taking.

**Timeline View**
Clicking into an account or prospect from either view shows a timeline of all actions taken by those prospects, providing valuable insights for account research.

**Leverage Slack Alerts**
We don’t expect you to monitor these views constantly, which is where Slack alerts come into play. Koala enables you to have Slack alerts sent to a channel when prospects within your target accounts trigger them. These alerts happen within 15 seconds, keeping you updated in real-time.

### Example: Using Koala for Account Research

A company started exploring a few months ago. Several users signed up and played around with the product, but the interesting moment we caught with Koala was when a solutions engineer started trying to get their Salesforce integration configured. We noticed they seemed to be getting stuck, so we sent over a Slack Connect channel to see if we could help out. Instead of immediately reaching out to book a demo, we provided value by offering assistance when they needed it most.

By leveraging Koala, you can gain deeper insights into your prospects' actions, prioritize your outreach, and engage with them in a value-added way.

**Happy selling!**
