**Koala** is an incredibly powerful tool for account research as part of your sales workflow. It helps you uncover previously hidden insights on the activity happening across your website and product.

### Using Koala for Account Research

#### Start with the Macro View

Spend a few minutes understanding what the company does, the industry they are in, and potential use cases. Use the Company tab to quickly learn about the company. If you already know about the company, you can skip this step. If not, you should be able to answer:

- Is this a tiny startup, a growth-stage company, or a giant enterprise?
- What industry are they in? (e.g., should you pitch them on Financial Services use cases?)
- Do they have a relevant tech stack? (e.g., if you need them to use Kubernetes, do they have it installed?)
- What do they do? If unclear, click on the domain to learn more.

Look for recent intent signals. Understanding who has shown recent intent and what those signals were can help tailor your messaging to be more relevant.

#### Zoom in on the Micro View

Use the granular visitor detail to make a plan of attack.

- Understand all known visitors. The Visitors tab shows how every visitor is engaging. If you’re lucky, you’ll get some logged-in visitors, allowing you to see exactly who they are. Look them up or enrich them to get their titles and understand what access to power you already have versus what access to power you need.
- If you have many anonymous visitors, consult the guide on driving more known users. Koala offers many ways to get more known visitors.

#### Understanding Anonymous Visitors

Combine their geographical location and account name to deduce their identities. Using tools like Sales Navigator can help make educated guesses about who was on the site.

### Example: Using Koala for Deep Account Research

#### Case Study: Pinecone

Pinecone started exploring a few months ago. Several users signed up and played around with the product, but the interesting moment we caught with Koala was when a solutions engineer started trying to get their Salesforce integration configured. We noticed they seemed to be getting stuck, so we sent over a Slack Connect channel to see if we could help out. Instead of immediately reaching out to book a demo, we provided value by offering assistance when they needed it most.

By leveraging Koala, you can gain deeper insights into your prospects' actions, prioritize your outreach, and engage with them in a value-added way.

**Happy selling!**
