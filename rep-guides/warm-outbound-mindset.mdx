# Developing a Warm Outbound Mindset

**Koala** provides a new data source for sellers, offering insights into the actions prospects are taking. This shift allows you to move from a completely cold outreach approach to what we call **warm outbound**, based on the specific actions prospects are engaging in.

### Visualizing Warm Outbound

What if you could wave a magic wand and have a clear view of all the people already in your store? Would you still be on the street trying to convince people to come in, or would you be helping the folks picking up your expensive items figure out if they meet their needs? That's what warm outbound is all about.

### The Challenge with Cold Outbound

Cold outbound is becoming increasingly difficult. Inboxes are flooded, new spam regulations are being introduced, and reply and meeting booked rates are extremely low, even for the best outreach efforts. Cold outbound today is like trying to convince people to come into your store without knowing what they’re interested in. Once sent, you lose visibility into the prospect’s actions, making cold outbound challenging.

### The Warm Outbound Advantage

Imagine seeing someone check out your most expensive product. You could observe them and engage in a completely different way. With warm outbound, think of your website and product as your store. You can see everything prospects are browsing, whether they’re diving into your tech docs, checking your solutions pages, case studies, blog articles, or engaging with specific features within the product. You have full visibility and can engage in a value-added way based on their actions.

### Key Engagement Signals

There are many different signals to look for when deciding how to engage with prospects. Here are some key themes:

- **Tech Docs**: Especially for paid and enterprise features.
- **Solutions Pages**: Particularly those highlighting enterprise features.
- **Guides and Help Center**: Engagement with guides, especially those on usage limits, can indicate strong interest.
- **Pricing Page Views**: Look for views longer than a minute as they show deeper consideration.

Specific bottom-of-funnel content can convert to SQO at almost 2x the rate of company sign-ups.

### Example: Engaging at the Right Time

Consider a prospect who signs up for your product. From our data, we know that a signup may be too early to engage, as people are often just exploring. Now, imagine this person starts diving into your tech docs, looking through integrations and SSO. This is where thinking like an advocate comes in—you have an opportunity to deliver value. For example, if the prospect is viewing your SSO docs, you might reach out with a quick question to see if they need any support in getting it configured.

### Advanced Engagement: Auto-Outbound Setup

A more advanced scenario involves prospects trying to set up auto-outbound after a few months, once they're more comfortable with the data. By this time, they've started trusting the data, seeing Slack notifications, and worrying about missing out on opportunities. They're venturing into the unknown of automating their processes. Imagine a rep reaching out with content on setting up auto-outbound and offering help on the project. Would you take that meeting?

### Shifting the Mindset

Warm outbound is all about shifting from thinking like a salesperson to thinking like an advocate, supporting prospects along their journey. Earn the right to have a sales conversation by delivering value throughout the entire buyer journey.

Dee XYZ, Head of Global CX at Miro, emphasizes this approach: 

> "Instead of jumping on a call, prospects want fast access to information when they need it. Or better yet, be intuitively presented with that information at the exact moment they need it."

### Getting Started with Warm Outbound

As you begin engaging with data from Koala, keep the warm outbound mindset in mind. Focus on being an advocate for your prospects, providing timely and valuable assistance.

**Happy selling!**
