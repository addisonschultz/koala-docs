**Warm outbound** is all about adding value to your prospects based on their specific actions and needs. This guide provides tips on how to effectively leverage Koala data to create value-added messaging and improve your outreach success.

### Key Principles for Warm Outbound Messaging

1. **Speed to Lead:**
   Try to get a message out the moment you notice intent. Customers report that intent intensity usually decays by 50% within 2-4 hours. Even something simple while the intent is high is better than sending the perfect message tomorrow. By tomorrow, there’s a good chance that your potential buyer is thinking about a new problem.

2. **Guide Them:**
   When a prospect is visiting your site or product, think about the next valuable resource you can share with them based on what they’re checking out. For example, if they’re looking at an enterprise solutions page, you might share a migration guide.
   Make yourself available via email to answer any quick questions or share best practices. Think like an advocate rather than a salesperson.

3. **Understand What Your Prospect Cares About:**
   Koala makes it easy to do account research in under five minutes. Your primary goal is to figure out what each person cares about. Use Koala’s profile pages to understand each person’s motivations, including who they are, how engaged they are, and what specifically they care about.

4. **Be Genuinely Helpful:**
   After understanding their interests, figure out how you can be genuinely helpful to them. If you’re looking at an end user, identify where they are stuck and offer a nudge. If you see an executive buyer checking out a broader resource, use that to tell them about an ROI story that might be interesting. Simple messages that come at a moment of high intent and are genuinely helpful perform much better than long sequences.

5. **Engage Naturally:**
   Consider what feels most natural from the prospect's point of view. If you want to ensure your message hits their inbox, send an email. If you're not connected and want to chat, add them on LinkedIn.
   For top accounts, consider using Slack Connect to engage in real-time.

### What Does Value-Add Messaging Look Like?

> “I’m your account manager – I just wanted to create a direct line for questions if you had anything I could answer over email.”

> “Given that you were looking at X, I thought Y might be interesting to you as I just helped Y solve this.”

> “Would it be helpful to hear best practices around X? Just helped [social proof customers] with this recently.”

> “Connecting the dots / multithreading: I saw that X, Y, Z were all poking around. Would it be helpful to get the team together for a top-to-bottom demo?”

### Engaging Known vs. Anonymous Users

**Known Users**

You can be more direct. For example, "I saw you checking out our enterprise solutions pages. I’m curious to understand your use case."

**Anonymous Users**

Be less definitive. For example, "I saw someone from Nike on the site. Did you have any questions about our enterprise solutions pages?"
Tip: Use slightly less definitive language, e.g., instead of "I saw you on the site," you could say "I saw someone from X on the site" or even not reference the site activity.

### Leveraging Multithreading

If you see multiple visitors from the same account, it’s a great opportunity to bring them together for a collective demo or to answer their questions.
