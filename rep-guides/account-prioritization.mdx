**Koala** is an incredibly powerful tool for prioritizing your sales efforts by identifying and focusing on high-value accounts. By leveraging insights into prospect activities, you can enhance your outreach strategy and improve your engagement success.

### Identifying and Prioritizing High-Value Accounts

#### ICP Fit

Fit is based on the enrichment characteristics of the company. We’ve analyze clSegment’s Salesforce instance and assigned a letter grade:

- **A**: This is a great ICP fit and deserves attention, outbound efforts, and multithreading.
- **B**: This is on the fringe of ICP and should be taken seriously but qualified carefully.
- **C/D**: These are likely not a fit for a sales-led deal (exceptions exist, but prioritize your efforts elsewhere).

Use the **Fit Score** to filter out bad prospects, focusing your efforts on accounts with the highest potential to buy.

#### Intent Scoring

Intent is a real-time score (0-100) based on the number of visitors, the amount of active time spent on the platform, and recent intent signals. More activity increases this number, but it decays rapidly if intent dies down:

- **80-100**: Very High intent
- **50-80**: High intent
- **20-50**: Medium intent
- **0-20**: Low intent

Use the **Intent Score** to decide which accounts to prioritize today. High intent scores indicate prospects who are currently active and potentially ready to engage.

### The Importance of Timing

Timing is crucial in sales. **Customers report that intent intensity usually decays by 50% within 2-4 hours**. This means that acting quickly when you notice high intent is essential. Even a simple, timely message can be more effective than a perfect message sent later. By tomorrow, there’s a good chance that your potential buyer is thinking about a new problem. Prioritizing accounts with high intent scores helps ensure you're engaging with prospects when their interest is at its peak.

### Real-Time Alerts and Why They Matter

Real-time alerts are crucial for staying updated on high-priority activities and making timely engagements. Koala’s real-time alerts keep you informed about important actions taken by prospects on your website and product.

#### Slack Alerts and Channels

We don’t expect you to monitor these views constantly, which is where Slack alerts come into play. Koala enables you to have Slack alerts sent to a channel when prospects within your target accounts trigger them. These alerts happen within 15 seconds, keeping you updated in real-time.

By leveraging Koala, you can gain deeper insights into your prospects' actions, prioritize your outreach, and engage with them in a value-added way.

**Happy selling!**
