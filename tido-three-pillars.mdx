# The three pillars of career happiness

The most common conversation I have with people is when they are considering a career move, whether it's their <a>"Shields Down" moment</a> or deep in the offer process. Over the years, I've seen some absurdly complex spreadsheets (eg., 15 pros and cons, expected value of equity, concerns about RSUs/Options/Strike Price, etc.). And while I do think there is a place for those spreadsheets, I've craved a simpler model. 

I think career happiness boils down to three key pillars. If you have 3/3 of these, you are almost certainly going to be wildly happy. If you have 2.5/3 of these, you're pretty good. Anything less and you'll be looking for another job soon.

**Pillar #1 - Compensation**
For senior folks (think expert-level ICs or senior manager plus), the way I'd frame the question to you is: if this company does well, could it be a life-changing outcome for you? I assume that you are excellent and will be working hard — in exchange for that excellence and hard work, you deserve a _chance_ at a life-changing outcome. There is some homework in here of figuring out with your partner/family/yourself what a life-changing outcome actually means. It could be a range of things — a downpayment for a house, the ability to support your parents in a more serious way, the financial freedom to retire early, or whatever else you value.

For junior folks, the way I'd frame the question to you is: is this compensation fair for the value you'll bring? I wouldn't focus too much on the area under the curve if you're in the first 5-10 years of your career — focus on the other two and come back to this pillar in a bit. 

**Pillar #2 - finding a you-shaped hole**
You will have more fun, make more impact, have better financial outcomes if you find a you-shaped hole. 

> When I joined Segment at a more senior stage (VP Engineering), it was clear to me that (1) Segment had found incredible PMF and (2) the one problem holding Segment back from glory was hiring a world-class engineering team. This was what I had to offer the world, so it was a perfect match. (And the rest was history...)

**Pillar #3 - peers and management chain**
As you probably know, the people matter a lot. To help you hone in on what matters most, I'd specifically try to understand if you would have any weak points up your management chain — I've found that as soon as there is a weak point anywhere in the chain, things unravel quickly. I'd also pay attention to your peers — are they world-class people you are going to learn from and have a blast working with. 

If you are inheriting a team you'd be managing, I wouldn't worry as much about the team. After all, it's now your job to make that team amazing!

# Firing people

At some point in the journey you will encounter this situation:

- someone is not performing and you want to manage them out
- you (or their old manager or whoever) have not given them appropriate feedback
- you have lost confidence in the person and would like to part ways ASAP

Try this:

> Unfortunately, I have lost confidence in this role being the right fit for your skillset. I sense that you have also lost enthusiasm about the role. I am happy to prepare a more structured Performance Improvement Plan, but I do recommend you consider taking X weeks of severance instead. I think this path will be easier for us both — you are a talented human and I believe will have more success with a different role setup. I'd ask that you sleep on it tonight and I will set time for us to meet at 9am tomorrow morning to discuss.

If you have lost confidence, it's better for everyone to call a spade a spade and not lead them on with a PIP that's likely not going to work out. However, if they believe they can succeed in the face of this feedback, it's your legal obligation as a company to give them that structured feedback. (If they've already gotten enough structured feedback that HR feels they've been given a fair chance, you can adjust the script to tell them that their last day is today.)

If this article made you think of someone on your team, do me a favor: stop thinking, start acting. Make a meeting with HR tomorrow. Deal with this issue by the end of the week. Sitting on it is not helping anyone (including the person who is underperforming — I promise you they are not happy either.)

<Note>
Before delivering this, you should check with your HR team to ensure that this is appropriate given your company policies. Also, you'll need their input on what severance your company is able to offer. I recommend 2-6 weeks, matching how long the PIP would be.
