# ðŸ‘‰ Introducing The Rep Playbook

Today, we're open-sourcing our Rep Playbook. Koala brings a new paradigm of customer-led GTM â€” a rep has never had so much intent data to look at.

In just about every onboarding program we run, we hear a common question: "What do I do with all this data?!" That's why we partnered with several of our customers (shout out to Vercel, Hightouch, Segment, Stytch!) to bring you our rep playbook. Use this for:

**Boost conversion 10x.** A great message sent quickly converts 10x better. If they are actively spending time on the site, they are actively thinking about you.

**Connect the dots for your accounts.** Koala gives you a view into the entire account, so you can play a strategic quarterbacking role. 

**Overachieve quota.** Koala turns 45 minutes of account research into 5 minutes. More high-quality messages means more meetings booked.
