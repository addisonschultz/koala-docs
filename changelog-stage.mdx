# ðŸ‘‰ Introducing Koala Weekly

Every week, you make an incredibly strategic decision: "Of the hundreds of accounts I could be prioritizing, where do I spend my time to maximize revenue?" The reality is you can only work a handful of accounts each week. Our research shows that hot accounts are 13x more likely to engage â€” why not spend your time there? 

- **Improve your win rate.** See when new champions activate on the product. See when an exec or two starts poking around your marketing site. Multithreading wins deals.
- **Don't waste time.** Cold outbound is a waste of time compared to warm inbound already on your site. Use your most precious resource wisely!
- **Find the low-hanging fruit.** Know when your existing book of business has a new org lighting up, so you can land an early upsell and pull forward that renewal.
