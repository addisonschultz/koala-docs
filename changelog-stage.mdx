Welcome to Day 4️⃣ of Koala Launch Week 🐨🚀🗓️ — our final day! The careful observer will note that we promised launches every day but didn't launch on Monday, so today is double-launch!

# 👉 Introducing Full Self-Serve & Koala Platform

As a company helping folks with PLG motions, we want to walk the walk. Today, we're announcing that we're **fully self-service** (we've always been self-service, but now we have self-service documentation that has been used to scale Koala to teams of 100+ reps). Skip the $100k contract and 3-6 month implementation cycle. Get it done in just hours. Seriously. (We're still happy to help of course!)

Get started here: https://getkoala.com/docs/get-started/what-is-koala

We're also launching the **Koala Platform**. We've been integrated with Hubspot CRM and Salesforce CRM since day one, but we wanted to introduce four new integrations:

- **Deanonymize anonymous traffic with Clearbit Reveal.** With the brand-new Powered by Clearbit program, Clearbit is offering 10k free Clearbit Reveal calls per month!
- **Set intent signals from your technical docs.** New ReadMe & Mintlify integrations. Want to see when someone is reading about setting up role-based access control on their workspace? This the most overlooked intent.
- **Automatically create outreach tasks.** Ensure no good intent signal is left behind with our Outreach integration!

Finally, we'd be remiss to end Launch Week without a huge thank you to our customers. We're excited to announce 100+ daily active customers, including many of the most elite go-to-market teams in the world. We'd love to work with you.
