# ðŸ‘‰ Introducing Koala Weekly

Every week, you make an incredibly strategic decision: "Of the hundreds of accounts I could be working on, where do I spend my time to maximize revenue?" Time spent on accounts without buying intent is time wasted. Koala Weekly is your cheat sheet.

- **Find the heat.** On average, a rep's territory has 5-10 new accounts heating up every week. Know which accounts these are, so you can spend your time here, rather than chasing cold outbound.
- **Improve your win rate.** See when new champions activate on the product. See when an exec or two starts poking around your marketing site. Multithreading wins deals.
- **Drive upsells.** Know when your existing book of business has a new org lighting up, so you can land an early upsell and pull forward that renewal.
