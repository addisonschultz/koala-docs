# ðŸ‘‰ Introducing The Rep Playbook

Today, we're open-sourcing our Rep Playbook. Koala brings a new paradigm of customer-led GTM â€” a rep has never had so much intent data to look at.

In just about every onboarding program we run, we hear a common question: "What do I do with all this data?!" That's why we partnered with several of our customers (shout out to Vercel, Hightouch, Segment, Stytch, Oso!) to bring you our rep playbook. Use this for:

**Boost conversion 10x.** A great message sent quickly converts 10x better. If they are actively spending time on the site, they are actively thinking about you.

**Connect the dots for your accounts.** Koala gives you a view into the entire account, so you can play a strategic quarterbacking role. 

**Overachieve quota.** Koala turns 45 minutes of account research into 5 minutes. More high-quality messages means more meetings booked.

Finally, remember that this playbook is open source, so we'd love to ask you to contribute back to the rep playbook! Give us feedback or tell us about your favorite Koala win, so we can help other reps learn! support@getkoala.com
